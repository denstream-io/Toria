# Toria

In the crowd, she whispers tales,
A caring heart that never veils.
Walking together, side by side,
In her stories, no secrets hide.
A dream to grow, just like the trees,
Her father's stature, a goal to seize.

Alone and quiet, often misunderstood,
She likes her alone time, it's all good.
A smile from her is rare but sweet,
Charming and shy, a lovely treat.

Like a graceful athlete, she moves,
Her body dances in a rhythmic groove.
Not sure about dreams, like an open book,
Life's journey, a path she undertook.

K-dramas makes her happy,
A world of stories where she likes to be.
Her voice is young but full of cheer,
Innocence blooming, crystal clear.

In this simple love tale, she's the art,
Painting blue skies, a dreamy start.
A canvas of dreams where love swirls,
A picture of her, in life's sweet twirls.
