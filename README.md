# Toria

In the crowd, she whispers tales,<br>
A caring heart that never veils.<br>
Walking together, side by side,<br>
In her stories, no secrets hide.<br>
A dream to grow, just like the trees,<br>
Her father's stature, a goal to seize.<br>

Alone and quiet, often misunderstood,<br>
She likes her alone time, it's all good.<br>
A smile from her is rare but sweet,<br>
Charming and shy, a lovely treat.<br>

Like a graceful athlete, she moves,<br>
Her body dances in a rhythmic groove.<br>
Not sure about dreams, like an open book,<br>
Life's journey, a path she undertook.<br>

K-dramas makes her happy,<br>
A world of stories where she likes to be.<br>
Her voice is young but full of cheer,<br>
Innocence blooming, crystal clear.<br>

In this simple love tale, she's the art,<br>
Painting blue skies, a dreamy start.<br>
A canvas of dreams where love swirls,<br>
A picture of her, in life's sweet twirls.<br>
